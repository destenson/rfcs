# Common Ledger Protocol (CLP)

## Preface

This document describes the Common Ledger Protocol (CLP), a ledger protocol for
bilateral liquidity relationships. It is similar in function to [Plugin RPC],
but has been rewritten to use OER instead of JSON, and extensibility features
have been added.

## Introduction

### Motivation

There are many different types of ledgers, and Interledger aims to interoperate
all of them. For fast ledgers that support hash time locks, memos, and
messaging, it is enough to wrap the ledger's API in a [Ledger Plugin]. These
allow you to send interledger payments through anyone else on that ledger who
is running your plugin.

In lots of scenarios, we don't have an underlying ledger that's fast enough to
do every ILP payment on-ledger. CLP can be used in these cases as long as the
two parties trust one another (up to a limit). If their trust limit is high
enough, they can transact without settling on an underlying ledger at all.

Currently, this case is handled by [ILP Plugin Virtual], which uses [Plugin
RPC] as its ledger protocol. JSON messages are passed back and forth to perform
transfers and send quote requests. Custom JSON messages can be added to extend
the Plugin RPC messages, just like sub-protocols can be added to CLP.

Because the use case for a bilateral ledger protocols is so ubiquitous, the CLP
has been designed to be efficient, and friendly to re-implementation.

### Scope

CLP manages conditional transfers, messaging requests, result/error reporting,
and carries sub-protocols (sometimes called side-protocols) for extensibility.
You can use ILP without using CLP. CLP is intended to be a well-suited solution
so that a new bilateral ledger protocol doesn't need to exist for every new use
case. It also includes functionality which is common between many different
ledger types, making it a good place to start from when creating a new
protocol.

This document describes the flow and data format that CLP uses, but not
sub-protocols. Sub-protocols include functionality like ledger metadata,
balance, automated settlement, and dispute resolution. Some protocols are
documented on [the wiki page]. They are carried in the protocol data of CLP
packets.

The CLP packet format is described exactly in the [CLP ASN.1 spec].

## Terminology

- **CLP** is the common ledger protocol, as described by this document and the
  ASN.1 spec.

- A **Sub-Protocol** is a protocol which isn't defined by CLP and is carried
  in the protocol data (see below).

- A **CLP Connection** is a websocket connection over which CLP packets are
  sent. Websockets are used because they provide message framing and allow for easy integration with browser-based code.

- **CLP Packets** are the protocol data units described in this document. They are
  formally defined in the [CLP ASN.1 spec].

- **Peers** are the parties on a CLP connection. Your peer is the party on the
  other side of the CLP connection.

- The **Bilateral Ledger** is the ledger which the peers on a CLP connection
  are keeping track of. The bilateral ledger is a persistent log of CLP
packets, which can be used to deduce the current balance between two peers and
the state of all transfers between them.

- **Authoritative State** is the authoritative view of the Bilateral Ledger's
  state, maintained by one or both of the peers. Because both peers on a CLP
connection can keep authoritative state, they can get into dispute if they
disagree on the state of a transfer. This usually happens when network latency
causes the peers to disagree about expiries. If one party keeps authoritative
state, the other party must trust them not to tamper with it.

- A request is **In-Flight** if the request has been sent out, but no response
  has been sent yet. A transfer is **In-Flight** if it has been prepared but
not yet fulfilled nor rejected.

## Overview

CLP is broken up into 4 different RPC requests, which can get 2 different
responses. Every CLP packet follows a common structure:

```
  +---------------+
1 | Type (1)      |
  +---------------+
1 | Request ID    |
2 | (2)           |
3 |               |
4 |               |
  +---------------+
1 | Length Prefix |
2 | (3)           |
  +---------------+
  | Packet-       |
  | Specific      |
  | Data          |
  . (4)           |
  .               |
  .               |
  |               |
  +---------------+
1 | Sub-Protocol  |
2 | Count (5)     |
  +---------------+
  | Sub-Protocol  |
  | Data          |
  . (6)           |
  .               |
  .               |
  |               |
  +---------------+
```

1. **Type**: A 1-byte value describing what type of CLP packet this is.
The values are described below, in [CLP Type IDs](#clp-type-ids).

2. **Request ID**: A random 4-byte value used to correlate requests 
and responses. This value MAY be sequential instead of random, but care must
be taken so that duplicate IDs are never in-flight at the same time.

3. **Length Prefix**: A 1-byte (if under 128) or 2-byte value, containing the
combined length of the packet-specific data and protocol data sections.

4. **Packet-Specific Data:** Fields specific to the type of CLP packet. Variable
length.

5. **Sub-Protocol Count:** Variable-length integer containing the number of
sub-protocols carried by this packet.

5. **Sub-Protocol Data:** A list of protocols, containing a string (the protocol's name), a 1-byte flag (containing the MIME type), and a length-prefixed octet string (containing the protocol's data). Exact description is below in [Sub-Protocol Data Format](#sub-protocol-data-format).

### CLP Type IDs

| ID | Type | Request/Response |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | `Ack` | Response |
| 2 | `Response` | Response |
| 3 | `Error` | Response |
| 4 | `Prepare` | Request |
| 5 | `Fulfill` | Request |
| 6 | `Reject` | Request |
| 7 | `Message` | Request |

### Sub-Protocol Data Format

```asn1
ContentType ::= INTEGER {
  applicationOctetString  (0),
  textPlainUtf8           (1),
  applicationJson         (2)
} (0..255)

ProtocolData ::= SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE {
  protocolName IA5String,
  contentType ContentType,
  data OCTET STRING
}
```

## Flow

CLP uses a simple RPC flow. A request-type CLP packet is sent, and a
response-type CLP packet is sent in response with the same request ID. The
request types are `Message`, `Prepare`, `Fulfill` and `Reject`, and the
response types are `Ack` (which may be [removed]), `Response`, and `Error`.

Because it would be too slow to atomically save all requestIds that are
processed, they are not idempotent. It is the responsibility of the requestor
to make sure they don't duplicate requestIds. The implementation should ensure
that no two in-flight requests are sent out with the same requestId. The
responder should always send back a response to a request with the same
requestId.

There are also a couple of tricky cases to handle:

- If an unexpected CLP packet is received, no response should be sent. An unexpected CLP packet is a response for which a request was not sent, or a response for a request which has already been responded to.
- If an unreadable CLP packet is received, no response should be sent. An unreadable CLP packet is one which is structurally invalid, i.e. terminates before length prefixes dictate or contains illegal characters.

These behaviors are important for preventing accidental feedback loops.  If an
unexpected packet triggered an error, that error may be unexpected to the
sender. The sender would reply with another unexpected error, causing an
infinite loop. Unreadable packets must be ignored too. If an application got
onto a CLP connection and spoke the wrong protocol, it would trigger an error
from CLP. This might trigger an error from the application, and it would
devolve into another infinite loop.

### Message

```asn1
Message ::= SEQUENCE {
  protocolData ProtocolData
}
```

`Message` is used for sending information to the peer. It contains no
packet-specific data, only protocol data. [ILQP] packets are attached under the
protocol name `ilp` with content-type `application/octet-stream`.

- `Response` is returned if the peer acknowledges the `Message`. If the peer
  has data to send in reply (e.g. a quote response), it is carried in the
protocol data.

- `Error` is returned if the peer is not able to process the `Message`, or there
  was an unexpected error and further `Message`s should not be sent. This does
not include ILP errors such as "No quote found", only the cases in which the
`Message` cannot be sent/processed at all.

### Prepare

```asn1
Prepare ::= SEQUENCE {
  transferId UInt128,
  amount UInt64,
  executionCondition UInt256,
  expiresAt Timestamp,
  --
  protocolData ProtocolData
}
```

`Prepare` is used to create a transfer on the bilateral ledger. The packet
data contains `transferId`, `amount`, `executionCondition`, and `expiresAt`.
`Prepare` is a request with side effects, because it creates a transfer with
the given details. This transfer begins in the `prepared` state.

`transferId` is a securely random 128-bit unique ID that references the
transfer.  `amount` is a 64-bit integer denominated in ledger base units. The
ledger base units can be anything, so long as both parties on the bilateral
ledger agree on their meaning. Examples of base units are "micro-XRP,"
"satoshi," or "nano-dollars settled over paypal." `executionCondition` is a
256-bit integer containing the SHA-256 hash of this conditional transfer's
fulfillment.  `expiresAt` is a ASN.1 UTC GeneralizedTime containing the expiry
of this transfer. The GeneralizedTime MUST be in UTC (i.e. no timezone info).

ILP payment packets are attached to the protocol data under the protocol
name `ilp` and the MIME type `application/octet-stream`. 

- `Response` is returned if the peer acknowledges the `Prepare`. This means the
  transfer is now `prepared` and has been applied to the balance. It may carry
sub-protocol data, for example a payment channel claim.

- `Error` is returned if the peer does not accept the transfer. This could be
  because it is incompatible with an existing transfer with the same ID (see
Idempotency below), or because it exceeds some constraint your peer has placed.
The amount could be too high, or could exceeds the balance. If the transfer ever enters the `prepared` state, an `Error` should not be returned. Instead, a `Reject` call should be made.

#### Idempotency

If a transfer with the given ID already exists in any state, a new transfer
should not be created. If the packet (including protocol data) matches an
existing transfer exactly and that transfer is in the `prepared` state, a
`Response` should be returned. If the packet (including protocol data) shares
the ID of an existing transfer but other details do not match, an `Error`
should be returned. If the packet (including protocol data) exactly
matches an existing transfer but that transfer is in the `fulfilled` state or
the `rejected` state, an `Error` should be returned.

#### Expiry

After the `expiresAt` date is reached, the transfer can no longer be fulfilled.
If one party on the CLP connection is keeping authoritative state, they MUST
send a `Reject` request to the other party. If both parties are keeping
authoritative state, they MAY independently expire the transfer (set the state
to `rejected` and roll it back) automatically.

### Fulfill

```asn1
Fulfill ::= SEQUENCE {
  transferId UInt128,
  fulfillment UInt256,
  --
  protocolData ProtocolData
}
```

`Fulfill` is used to change an existing transfer from the `prepared` state to
the `fulfilled` state. The packet-specific data of `Fulfill` is made up of `transferId`
and `fulfillment`. `Fulfill` is a request with side effects: it changes the
state of the transfer and finalizes the transfer's balance update. If the
transfer is already fulfilled, no changes are applied.

`transferId` is a 128-bit unique ID, which references an existing transfer.
`fulfillment` is a 256-bit integer, containing the preimage of the
`executionCondition` of the referenced transfer.

A `Fulfill` request must be sent from the receiver of the referenced transfer,
not the sender.

A `Fulfill` request is successful if `transferId` references an existing
transfer in the `prepared` state, the `fulfillment` is the SHA-256 preimage of
the referenced transfer's `executionCondition`, and the current time (when the
request is being processed) is before the referenced transfer's `expiresAt`.

A `Fulfill` request is also successful if the transfer is in the `fulfilled`
state, and this packet matches the one that fulfilled the transfer,
including protocols but not including requestId.

- `Response` is returned if the request is successful.  This means the
  transfer's state is now `fulfilled`, and its balance change has been
finalized.

- `Error` is returned if there is no transfer with the given ID, the
  fulfillment does not match the condition, the expiresAt has already passed,
or the transfer has been `rejected`.

### Reject

```
Reject ::= SEQUENCE {
  transferId UInt128,
  rejectionReason InterledgerPacket, -- must contain an InterledgerProtocolError
  --
  protocolData ProtocolData
}
```

`Reject` is used to change an existing transfer from the `prepared`
state to the `rejected` state. The packet-specific data of `Reject` is made up
of `transferId` and `rejectionReason`.

`transferId` is a 128-bit unique ID, which references an existing transfer.
`rejectionReason` is an [ILP Error], containing the reason that this transfer
was rejected.

A `Reject` request must come from the receiver of the referenced transfer,
not the sender.

A `Reject` request is successful if `transferId` references an existing
transfer in the `prepared` state.

A `Reject` request is also successful if `transferId` references an existing
transfer in the `rejected` state, and this packet matches the one that
rejected this transfer, including protocols but not including requestId.

- A `Response` is returned if the request is successful. This indicates that
  the balance changes of the referenced transfer have been rolled back.

- An `Error` is returned if the request was not successful. _TODO: create
  error codes that distinguish the different failure cases_.

## CLP Connection Establishment

This section describes how peers establish a CLP connection. For this purpose, the peer initiating the connection is called a **client** and the other peer a **server**.

### WebSocket Handshake

TODO: The WebSocket handshake could be used to negotiate the CLP version. See https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/issues/294

### Authentication

Once the WebSocket connection has been established, the client is expected to send an authentication token within 30 seconds. The client MUST send this token before sending any other CLP packets. The token is sent using the sub-protocol `auth` wrapped in a `Message`. An example in ASN.1 notation is:

```asn1
auth-request protocolData ::= {
  protocolName "auth",
  contentType 0,
  data `73757065722073656375726520746F6B656E'H -- hex representation of the token
}
```

If the server receives any other CLP packets before the token, or the provided token is wrong, the server MUST reply with an `Error` and MUST close the connection. The error SHOULD contain the sub-protocol `auth` and an error message stating `Invalid Token`. An example in ASN.1 notation is:

```asn1
auth-wrong-token protocolData ::= {
  protocolName "auth",
  contentType 1,
  data `496E76616C696420546F6B656E'H -- hex representation of the string Invalid Token
}
```

The server MUST close the connection if the client does not send a token within 30 seconds after opening the connection. Before closing the connection, the server MAY send a `Message` informing the client that the authentication timed out. Such a message might be useful for debug purposes, but is not strictly necessary. An example in ASN.1 notation is:

```asn1
auth-timeout protocolData ::= {
  protocolName "debug",
  contentType 1,

  -- hex representation of the string Authentication Timeout
  data `41757468656E7469636174696F6E2054696D656F7574'H
}
```

The server MUST reply with an empty `Response` if the provided token is valid. From this point onwards, the connection is considered to be authenticated and normal CLP operation can proceed.
